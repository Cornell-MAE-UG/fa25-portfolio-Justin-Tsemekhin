For a fluid mechanics class we were given a used leafblower and instructed to record a video describing the technical function of its components. For the dissection of the leafblower, I was responsible for extracting the engine from its casing with a dremel to cut around the stripped bolts. I then removed the plastic components and reassembled it to show how eveything interects. In the video linked above, I calculated the specific speeds of the radial flow pump in order to explain design choices. An analysis of the converging nozzle, in conjunction with the Bernoulli Equation along with conservation principles, led to a better understanding of how fluid accelerates in the nozzle.
