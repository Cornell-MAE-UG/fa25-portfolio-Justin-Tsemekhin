This image shows a modified CAD model for a torque wrench with acceptable factors of safety for a 600 lb-in moment. The material used for calculations is Aluminum, 2017, T4 given its high yield strength (57.9 ksi) and relatively low cost (~$1.34/lb). This material is one of the cheapest that meets the design criteria, as calculated by hand, and would allow for lower cost for production.
