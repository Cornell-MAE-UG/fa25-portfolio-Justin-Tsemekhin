This image shows a modified CAD model for a torque wrench with acceptable factors of safety for a 600 lb-in moment. The material used for calculations is Aluminum, 2017, T4 given its high yield strength (57.9 ksi) and relatively low cost (~$1.34/lb). This material is one of the cheapest that meets the design criteria, as calculated by hand, and would allow for lower cost for production. 

## **Dimensioned CAD Model**

This updated model of the a rectangular torque wrench features a 4.5" handle for improved comfort whilst maintaining other basic dimensions. The driver is 3/8", the overall length 16", the width 0.75" (1.1" at the widest part of the handle) and is 0.5" in height.
